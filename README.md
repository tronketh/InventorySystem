# InventorySystem
* In this inventory system currently there is no limit to number of objects added and all items stack up to one side.
* Number of Slots can be changed
* Currently I made it so that all the inventory slots with any item will be shifted to top right and empty slots after
* For the scene included is a test scene, yet to add functionality selecting an object for pickup, and dropping the object in real world after removing from inventory . In this scene there are two Ball which will be added to inventory on pickup
* 'I' for opening and closing inventory (Game paused when in inventory)
* Currently 'E' is for picking up item(will be added into inventory) and when in inventory 'Q' is for dropping item(will onlybe removed from inventory)
